# Creational Methods: TypeScript Decorators Module

This module provides a set of TypeScript decorators designed to streamline the creation of classes by automatically adding builder, getter, setter, and method-chaining functionalities. The decorators simplify class management, making code more readable and maintainable.

## Features

- **Builder Decorator (`Builder`)**: Enables the creation of a `builder` method that collects properties and builds an instance with consistent public field mappings.
- **Getter Decorator (`Getter`)**: Automatically adds getter methods for class properties, simplifying property access.
- **Setter Decorator (`Setter`)**: Adds setter methods to enable property mutation in a consistent manner.
- **With Decorator (`With`)**: Facilitates method chaining by adding methods prefixed with `with` for easy property assignment.

## Installation

Ensure that Node.js is installed, then integrate this module into your TypeScript project.

```
npm i creational-methods
